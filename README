# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews using BERT  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the use of **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. The goal is to classify reviews into **positive, neutral, or negative sentiments** and provide actionable insights for restaurants to improve customer satisfaction and service quality.  

Unlike conventional methods, BERTâ€™s transformer-based architecture captures **context and semantics** of text, making it highly effective in understanding customer opinions.
